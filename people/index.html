	<p><img src="/pics/apike.jpg" height="200" class='align-left'>
	<p>I'm a Lecturer at the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/">Department of Psychology at the University of York</a>. 
		I am interested in computational modelling (especially reinforcement learning), neuroimaging, and psychometrics. I have experience working in the fields of eating disorders and anxiety disorders. </p>
	<p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/">Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience</a>, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/neuroscience-and-mental-health" >Neuroscience and Mental Health Group</a>, working with <a href="http://www.oliverjrobinson.com/index.html"> Professor Oliver Robinson</a>. 
		I completed my DPhil at the <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Psychiatry</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. 
		During my DPhil, I worked on eating disorders and compulsivity, using a range of methods, including multimodal MRI, psychopharmacology, and computational modelling.
		My DPhil supervisors were <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/phil-cowen">Professor Philip Cowen</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/rebecca-park">Professor Rebecca Park</a>. </p>
	<p>I have previously completed an MSc in Neuroscience and a BA in Psychology and Philosophy.</p>
