We are delighted to announce that we've been awarded a grant, along with collaborators <a href="https://tobywise.com/">Dr Toby Wise</a>, <a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ritwik7/">Dr Ritwik Niyogi</a> and <a href="https://lei-zhang.net/">Dr Lei Zhang</a>. The title of the grant is 'Anxiety and depression in young people: who do they affect, who seeks treatment, and who responds to treatment?'. 

This is our summary of the planned research: *'Anxiety and depression are common conditions â€“ yet we do not understand what affects vulnerability, who seeks support, or why people respond to treatments in different ways. Led by Dr Alexandra Pike at the University of York, the team will use machine learning techniques to understand the factors that affect these aspects of mental health over time. The team will produce an online application so researchers, educators, clinicians and policy makers can use the results, and young people and their families can access insights as well.'*
