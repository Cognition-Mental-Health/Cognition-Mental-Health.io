Congratulations to Gemma Sarigu, who received funding from the University of York's Department of Psychology to complete a research internship over five weeks of the summer vacation. <a href="https://cognition-mental-health.github.io/people/#Gemma+Sarigu">1+3 Gemma</a> will be running an online study on the relationship between catastrophizing and how people integrate stressful life events into their personal life narrative. She will also be examining the relationship between catastrophizing and perceived socioeconomic status.
