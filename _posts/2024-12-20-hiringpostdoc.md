The lab recently received an <a href="https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/66m-springboard-emerging-research-leaders">Academy of Medical Sciences Springboard Award</a> to investigate the relationship between feelings of control, self-efficacy and eating disorder symptoms. As part of this grant, <a href="https://jobs.york.ac.uk/vacancy/research-associate-574672.html">we are hiring a postdoc!</a> 

<h1>Department</h1>
The Cognition and Mental Health Lab, led by Dr Alex Pike, at the Department of Psychology, University of York is seeking a Postdoctoral Research associate for 23 months. 

<h1>Role</h1>
The post holder will work on a Springboard grant awarded to the PI, Dr Alex Pike, entitled ‘Understanding the relationship between eating disorders, self-efficacy and control-seeking’. The main purpose of the role is to conduct research using computational psychiatry techniques to understand how control-seeking and self-efficacy may differ in those with elevated eating disorder traits. The main responsibilities include: designing and programming cognitive tasks, collecting data online, analysis and interpretation of data, and disseminating research results (via publications, conference presentations, and public engagement and outreach). This role will also involve liaising with collaborators, and there will be plenty of training opportunities (including to be the first author on papers, to attend and present at conferences, and to work with PhD students and other more junior researchers). 

<h1>Skills, Experience & Qualification needed</h1>
The successful candidate should have an interest (though not necessarily experience) in computational psychiatry, and a background in either a) cognitive neuroscience, b) computer science, or c) psychiatry/mental health. 

The successful candidate should have a track record of conducting individual and collaborative research, with some coding ability in a language such as Python or R and ability to perform statistical analysis.

The successful candidate will be collaborative and have a positive attitude and enthusiasm for working with other staff and students.
