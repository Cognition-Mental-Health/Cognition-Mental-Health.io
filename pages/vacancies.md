	<h2>PhD</h2>
  <p>If you are interested in doing your PhD in the lab, please <a href="mailto:alex.pike@york.ac.uk">email me</a>. In particular, I'm looking for students who are motivated and interested in cognitive neuroscience and mental health: coding experience isn't necessary! </p>
  <h3>PhD funding</h3> 
  <p>To embark on a PhD most students need external funding (and, indeed, I would always recommend obtaining some). I have no funded positions at the moment, but there are plenty of options listed on the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/prospective/postgraduate/research/funding/#:~:text=We%20regularly%20receive%20funding%20for,maintenance%20grant%20for%20living%20expenses.">York Psychology Department funding webpage.</a> I'm always happy to talk through funding options with potential students.</p><br/>
  <h2>Research Assistant (RA)</h2>
  <p>I currently have no funding for RAs, and do not believe that it is equitable to offer research assistantships that are unfunded or honorary, because I believe this contributes to some of the inequalities in academia. I am, however, always keen to listen to ideas for obtaining funding for RAs, and it might be worth noting schemes such as the <a href="https://www.bap.org.uk/internship.php">BAP summer research internship scheme</a></BAP> </p>
  <h2>Postdoc</h2>
  <p>I currently have no funding for postdocs. I would be very happy to support an application for a postdoc to be part of the lab - please <a href="mailto:alex.pike@york.ac.uk">email me</a>! </p>
