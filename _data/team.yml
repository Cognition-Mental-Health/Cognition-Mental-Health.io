    I'm a Lecturer at the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/">Department of Psychology at the University of York</a>. 
    I am interested in computational modelling (especially reinforcement learning), neuroimaging, and psychometrics. I have experience working in the fields of eating disorders and anxiety disorders.
    
    Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/">Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience</a>, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/neuroscience-and-mental-health" >Neuroscience and Mental Health Group</a>, working with <a href="http://www.oliverjrobinson.com/index.html"> Professor Oliver Robinson</a>. 
    I completed my DPhil at the <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Psychiatry</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. 
    
    During my DPhil, I worked on eating disorders and compulsivity, using a range of methods, including multimodal MRI, psychopharmacology, and computational modelling.
    
    My DPhil supervisors were <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/phil-cowen">Professor Philip Cowen</a> and <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/rebecca-park">Professor Rebecca Park</a>.
    
    I have previously completed an MSc in Neuroscience and a BA in Psychology and Philosophy.

  description: My name is Gemma Sarigu, and I am a first-year Psychology Undergraduate at the University of York. I am currently undertaking a Summer Research Internship with Dr Pike, looking at the relationship between catastrophising and how well people deal with(integrate) stressful life events. The research will also assess links with perceived socioeconomic status. My research interests include mental health conditions and different psychological therapies available to support people, with a specific interest in young people's mental health. I am interested in a career in the mental health area as a researcher or clinical psychologist.
