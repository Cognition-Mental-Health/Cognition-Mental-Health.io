    I'm a Lecturer at the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/">Department of Psychology at the University of York</a>. 
		I am interested in computational modelling (especially reinforcement learning), neuroimaging, and psychometrics. I have experience working in the fields of eating disorders and anxiety disorders.
    Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/">Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience</a>, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/neuroscience-and-mental-health" >Neuroscience and Mental Health Group</a>, working with <a href="http://www.oliverjrobinson.com/index.html"> Professor Oliver Robinson</a>. 
		I completed my DPhil at the <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Psychiatry</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. 
		During my DPhil, I worked on eating disorders and compulsivity, using a range of methods, including multimodal MRI, psychopharmacology, and computational modelling.
		My DPhil supervisors were <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/phil-cowen">Professor Philip Cowen</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/rebecca-park">Professor Rebecca Park</a>.

    My name is Lucy Stafford and I am a Masters of Science in Psychology graduate from the University of York. I am currently studying for a Masters of Art in Social Research, also at the University of York, as part of the 1+3 Advanced Quantitative Methods funding I received from the Economic and Social Research Council. I will officially start my PhD in the Autumn of 2023. 
    
    My research interests include interoception, body image, eating behaviours and disorders, and food choices. My PhD research will explore the relationships between gastric interoception, body image, and food choices.
